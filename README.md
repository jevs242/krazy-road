## ðŸ“– Project Experience

For a class portfolio, I developed **Krazy Road** to expand my game development skills and build a complete mobile game using **Unity**. I chose the endless runner genre because of its popularity in mobile gaming, and as a way to challenge myself with features like in-game ads and a shop system.

Over the course of one month, I successfully:
- Developed a full mobile endless runner game in Unity
- Integrated a working in-game **shop**
- Implemented **advertising features** for monetization
- Released the game on **Google Play**

Integrating ads proved to be a significant challenge, but I overcame it through persistence and hands-on problem solving. Completing this project helped me:
- Build experience in mobile game development
- Learn Unityâ€™s mobile publishing and monetization tools
- Add a published mobile game to my portfolio

Enjoy exploring the project! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
